# Artificial-Intelligence-Project
This is our final semester AI project 
Breif Explanation about all the files we have uploaded:

Unzip.ipynb to unzing the dataset as it was originally compressed in tar.gz

EDA.ipynb is the exploratory data analysis that we performed on the whole dataset, in order to get the idea of how the variables in csv are linked to one another

P&NF file Extraction.ipynb we exxtracted out only those images in which pneumonia and no disease were detected 

Train Test split.ipynb in order to sepereate the test data, so we can easily apply pre processing only on training set

Gan.ipynb generating more images for Pneumonia dataest to handle class imbalance

ResNet.ipynb is the transfer learning model we used for classification
